# idl-login-screen

The purpose of this project is to introduce the reader to Svelte/Sapper as a really modern way to building web applications.
Let's have a look at how it functions and think for ourselves if it is probably the high time to ditch React altogether.

## layout

The [scr](src/) directory hosts the [front-end](src/front-end/README.md) and the [back-end](src/back-end/README.md).
Later one more directory will be added with scripts that will pack both guys into containers/unikernels.

## tech requirements

1. node.js version is [14.10.1](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V14.md#14.10.1). Please use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) for node version management.
2. instead of npm/yarn/whatever this repository uses the magnificient [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/self-installer#readme) version `5.5.13` as of the time of writing.

Please keep dependencies up-to-date - people behind it are investing their lives to inhance it and fix bugs on daily basis.
